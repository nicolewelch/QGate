# QGate
### A minimal calculator and simulator for single-qubit quantum programs

A script-style program that inputs a series of gates to apply to a |0> qubit, outputs the final state of that qubit, as well as the probabilities of the qubit collapsing to |0> and |1>


### Requirements
- Python  
- Numpy
